## Abastus version 1.0

This is an [Ionic 3](https://ionicframwork.com) and [Angular 4](https://angular.io) framworks.

**The Application** it's intented to be a sales mobile app.

So far, it has implemented the `login` function and a small part of the `sales` page.

The authentication it's done through a Sprig-Boot OAuth2 backend project (*wich I will share very soon*). This project has the particularity that both: The Authorization Server and The Resource Server are standalone spring-boot projects.

For more on any of this projects feel free to contact me.
